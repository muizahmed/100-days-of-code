# Beginner Project Journal (Day 1 - Day 14)

***

## Day 1
* Today was the first day of 100 Days of Code. Learnt some basics about functions and variables.
### Project Details (TODO Items provided by Angela in the comments):
1. Band Name Generator 
   * The Band Name Generator takes user's city name and pet's name as input, and concactenates them to generate and print a band name.
   * **Repl.it Link:** https://repl.it/@MuizAhmed01/band-name-generator-start#main.py
   * **GitHub Link:** https://github.com/muizahmed/band-name-generator
### Learnt about:
* Basics of Functions and Variables
* input() and print() functions
* String Concactenation

***

## Day 2
* On the second day of 100 Days of Code, built some exciting projects and learnt about data types in Python.
### Project Details (Instructions and README files provided by Angela):
1. Sum of Digits
    * Created a project that takes a two-digit number as an input and prints the sum of those two digits. 
    * **Repl.it Link:** https://repl.it/@MuizAhmed01/day-2-1-exercise#main.py
    * **GitHub Link:** https://github.com/muizahmed/sum-of-digits
2. BMI Calculator
    * Created a project that takes weight and height as input, converts them into float, and then prints BMI by using the BMI formula.
    * **Repl.it Link:** https://repl.it/@MuizAhmed01/day-2-2-exercise#main.py
    * **GitHub Link:** https://github.com/muizahmed/bmi-calculator
3. Life in Weeks
    * Created a project that takes current age as input, and returns life remaining in weeks.
    * **Repl.it Link:** https://repl.it/@MuizAhmed01/day-2-3-exercise#main.py
    * **GitHub Link:** https://github.com/muizahmed/life-in-weeks
### Learnt about:
* Data Types in Python
* TypeError and Type Conversion
* Mathematical Operations in Python
* Use of f-strings to manipulate other data types in strings

## Day 20 
* Today was a bit of a challenging day, there were not enough code challenges, it was mostly just coding along with Angela. Don't really feel confident about the concepts learnt today, as they haven't been put to test yet.
### Project Details (Coding Along with Angela):
1. The Famous Snake Game - Part I
   * Created a project using Turtle module from Python
   * So far, there is a moving snake (formed using three turtle objects on the screen that can be controlled using arrow keys)
   * Code not completed yet, full project link in the next day's section
### Learnt about:
* Using screen.delay() function from TurtleScreen
* Using time module to cause a delay in the screen refresh rate
* Further Object-Oriented Programming
* Further onkey() method from Turtle
* Problem-solving skills in general
