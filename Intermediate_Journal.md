## Day 20 
* Today was a bit of a challenging day, there were not enough code challenges, it was mostly just coding along with Angela. Don't really feel confident about the concepts learnt today, as they haven't been put to test yet.
### Project Details (Coding Along with Angela):
1. The Famous Snake Game - Part I
   * Created a project using Turtle module from Python
   * So far, there is a moving snake (formed using three turtle objects on the screen that can be controlled using arrow keys)
   * Code not completed yet, full project link in the next day's section
### Learnt about:
* Using screen.delay() function from TurtleScreen
* Using time module to cause a delay in the screen refresh rate
* Further Object-Oriented Programming
* Further onkey() method from Turtle
* Problem-solving skills in general
