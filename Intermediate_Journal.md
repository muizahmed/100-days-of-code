## Day 20 
* Today was a bit of a challenging day, there were not enough code challenges, it was mostly just coding along with Angela. Don't really feel confident about the concepts learnt today, as they haven't been put to test yet.
### Project Details (Coding Along with Angela):
1. The Famous Snake Game - Part I
   * Created a project using Turtle module from Python
   * So far, there is a moving snake (formed using three turtle objects on the screen that can be controlled using arrow keys)
   * Code not completed yet, full project link in the next day's section
### Learnt about:
* Using screen.delay() function from TurtleScreen
* Using time module to cause a delay in the screen refresh rate
* Further Object-Oriented Programming
* Further onkey() method from Turtle
* Problem-solving skills in general

## Day 20 
* Took two days to complete the content from Day 21. Didn't enjoy making the Snake game as much as I expected, Angela changed the format for this part from code challenges to coding along. Didn't get to test if I understood the code fully, plan to improve this projects and make tweaks to it later on by myself.
1. The Famous Snake Game - Part II
   * Continued building the Snake game using Turtle module
   * The project is now completed and the game is fully functional
### Learnt about:
* Using screen.write() function from Turtle
* Further Object-Oriented Programming
* Class inheritance, subclasses, and superclasses
* Slicing lists and tuples in Python
