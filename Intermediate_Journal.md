# Intermediate Project Journal (Day 15 - Day 31)

***

## Day 20 
* Today was a bit of a challenging day, there were not enough code challenges, it was mostly just coding along with Angela. Don't really feel confident about the concepts learnt today, as they haven't been put to test yet.
### Project Details (Coding Along with Angela):
1. The Famous Snake Game - Part I
   * Created a project using Turtle module from Python
   * So far, there is a moving snake (formed using three turtle objects on the screen that can be controlled using arrow keys)
   * Code not completed yet, full project link in the next day's section
### Learnt about:
* Using screen.delay() function from TurtleScreen
* Using time module to cause a delay in the screen refresh rate
* Further Object-Oriented Programming
* Further onkey() method from Turtle
* Problem-solving skills in general

***

## Day 21
* Took two days to complete the content from Day 21. Didn't enjoy making the Snake game as much as I expected, Angela changed the format for this part from code challenges to coding along. Didn't get to test if I understood the code fully, plan to improve this projects and make tweaks to it later on by myself.
### Project Details (Coding Along with Angela):
1. The Famous Snake Game - Part II
   * Continued building the Snake game using Turtle module
   * The project is now completed and the game is fully functional
   * GitHub link: https://github.com/muizahmed/snake-game
### Learnt about:
* Using screen.write() function from Turtle
* Further Object-Oriented Programming
* Class inheritance, subclasses, and superclasses
* Slicing lists and tuples in Python

***

## Day 22
* A fun project, but not as complicated as I wanted it to be. Tried automating the other paddle 


***

## Day 23
* FINALLY! A fun challenge, and the capstone project. Today, I made the crossy-road-like game from scratch using Angela's verbal instructions. Had a lot of fun, got to finally apply what we've learnt so far with regards to OOP. Much more organized code, I hope.
### Project Details (Basic program requirements provided by Angela):
1. Turtle Crossing Project
    * Built a game from scratch using the Python Turtle Module
    * The game has functionality similar to Crossy Roads
    * The player can control the turtle using the arrow key in order to get to the finish line without hitting any moving objects.
    * GitHub link: https://github.com/muizahmed/turtle-crossing/blob/main/README.md
### Learnt about:
* Further OOP Style 
* Creating multiple objects from a single class
* Using OOP in a project created from scratch
