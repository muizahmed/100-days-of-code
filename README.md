# 100-days-of-code
On 20th November, 2020, I started [100 Days of Code Python Course by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) on Udemy.
I got the idea for organizing my projects from the course after taking a look at [Osama Al Olabi's Journal](https://github.com/OsamaAlOlabi/100-days-of-python-code).
For projects from Day 1 through Day 14, I'll add links to to them in the Beginner Projects Journal, and so on.
I'm new to GitHub, so it'll definitely take some getting used to, but I'm excited!
